I'm an Information and Knowledge Systems student pursuing my BSc degree from the University of Pretoria. During my course of study, I have gained proficiency in various programming languages, including C++, Java, JavaScript (including Node.js and Angular), PHP, and Python. Through my coursework and personal projects, I have developed web applications, and designed user interfaces to hone my skills.

Apart from my technical skills, I have a strong foundation in problem-solving. I can easily break down complex problems into smaller components to develop effective solutions. My skills have been utilized in various projects.

Presently, I'm interning at Monkey and River, where I'm contributing to real-world projects. My role involves designing and implementing software solutions, debugging code, and collaborating with team members. I'm a quick learner and always on the lookout for opportunities to enhance my skills and contribute to the success of the team.
